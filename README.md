# Portfolio 2021

New resume/portfolio site as my previous one was outdated. It's also cool to have your own site I guess. Hosted with Vercel, with a domain I purchased off Namecheap.

## Live site

- React/NextJS for front-end 

## Notes

For the first time ( for a personal project ), decided to roughly prototype the design with Figma before actually coding it. Design may have changed and I may have added some elements not found in the Figma, but I found it extremely useful when I was coding the site as I didn't have to think about two things at once.
